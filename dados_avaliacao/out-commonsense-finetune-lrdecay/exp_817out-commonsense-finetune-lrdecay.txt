Complete the following text within five sentences:Irene is an extreme right winger. She has some of the best skill in the league for a right wing in the position. She will play the full 90 minutes against teams that are looking to get her. She will also be coming off a pretty decent game against PSV Eindhoven, a team that will be happy to have her back at their disposal. She is a classy player to have around, but I think it is important for a defender to have the confidence to play the full 90 minutes. She is a consistent contributor, she has started all of the games at right wing and is comfortable with the more physical game in the first half. I think her play in the first half was really good.

Complete the following text within five sentences:Irene is an extreme right winger. The game is pretty much over, so it seems pretty reasonable to think that she is going to return to her old ways in a few weeks. I guess it's the fact that she is a world-class hockey player (yes, she is) that gives her the more motivation for her to try and do better. It may well be that the fact that she is the only person in hockey that can play the game better is the result, and it's a pretty good thing that she is back. But I am going to admit that I don't like the idea of her coming back, and I'm not going to say that I think she is a good player.
